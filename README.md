# 3D-Rendering (High School Project)

My high school coding project. A 3D rendering software built from scratch in C++. Algorithm for calculating projection of points onto screen plane (in 3D space) is through trignometry and not linear algebra as it was devised from scratch from my knowledge then.

WARNING This software is currently very very un-documented. __Do not try to understand it.__ 

Once upon a time I used to understand it well. Now it's just history. It uses outdated graphics libraries and for some reason I decided to create my own file format as well (.p3dm) fun stuff. I guess it was nice that I atleast got out some original code at the pinnacle of my coding time.
